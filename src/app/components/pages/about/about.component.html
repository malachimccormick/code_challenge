  <h1>Thank You</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for allowing me to have this oppurtunity. I have created a basic CRUD application. Normally I would point to a database that has the information needed. In this case I have simulated one with a DB.json file so the data does not stick but the UI simulates it. I have included the code to put, post, delete and get to show I do know how to do them. Again, thank you for the oppurtunity and I look forward to working with you.
